# Clock-Driven Scheduling

Programs for calculating clock-driven schedules using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Constraint Programming (CP).

Prerequisites to execute ILP examples:

* Julia programming language (tested with Julia v0.6.4) with JuMP package.
* A solver such as [Gurobi Optimizer](https://www.gurobi.com/solutions/gurobi-optimizer/) (tested with Gurobi v8.1.1) or [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/).

Prerequisites to execute CP examples:

* IBM CPLEX
